## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## 1) makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object
## that can cache its inverse.
## 2) cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. However, It first checks
# to see if the inverse has already been calculaed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. Otherwise, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via the
# setinverse function.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
